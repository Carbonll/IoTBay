UTS Group Assignment, online web application.

Create your own branch for the feature you're working on, derived from the master branch. 

Create your DAO methods in srs/uts/isd/model/dao/DBManager.java, e.g. findUser, findProduct, etc.

When adding your controller/servlet classes, don't forget to declare them in the web.xml file in WEB-INF folder as well, otherwise they wont work.

Make sure to run the application through index.jsp, as that is the page that declares ConnServlet to allow for all controllers/servlets to work.
